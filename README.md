# gae-django-project-template
gae-django-project-template

At some point after I developed like 5th project on GAE I felt that I should have a ready-to-use repository with the snapshot of the django project that already has all the modules installed and ready to go for GAE.

This template installed into GAE can be seen there: http://gae-django-project-template.appspot.com/

After clone remember to:
* change origin to your own repo
* change application: gae-django-project-template in app.yaml to fit your project id
* if you intend to use fabfile - change GAE_APP_ID in settings.py 

So here you go.
